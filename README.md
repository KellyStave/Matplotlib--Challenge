# Matplotlib--Challenge

Observations from this challenge:
  1. At the end the study it appears that the mice who received the Capomulin and Ramicane had smaller tumors by volume than those who received Infubinol and Ceftamin.
  2. For Capomulin there seems to be a positive correlation betwen the size of the mouse and the average volume of the tumor grown.
  3. Capomulin treatment for mouse l509 had an initial growth in tumor between days 10 and 20, after day 20 there is a decrease in the tumor growth until approximately day 35
      when tumor volume begins to increase again.
  4. Approximately the same number of male and female mice were included in the study, which removes gender as a potential factor in outcome.
  5. Additional analysis that may be of value would be the age of the mice at the time of Drug Regimen initiation to determine if age is a factor in outcome. 
  6. Another factor that would be of further evaluation may be the number of metastatic sites observed and when they were first noted.
